# Workflow guide:
- Daily meetings to discuss potential problems, ideas and check who is working on what.
- Do not commit directly to the main branch. Instead use pull requests on dev.
- Every pull request should be accepted by at least one other person.
- Project will be preceded by creating a use-case diagram.
